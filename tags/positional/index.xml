List of imbalances Minor pieces: the interplay between Bishops and Knights Pawn structure: doubled/isolated/backward/passed pawns, islands. Space Material Files and squares: files, ranks and diagonals act as pathway, while squares act as homes. Development: this is a temporary balance. Initiative: also temporary. Don&amp;#39;t look at individual moves! Try to understand the position, before starting calculation on individual moves. Bishop vs Knights It&amp;rsquo;s the most important imbalance of the game.</description></item><item><title>The Center, Territory and Space</title><link>http://yanghu.github.io/chess/posts/amateurs-mind/center-and-space/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 23:18:05 -0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://yanghu.github.io/chess/posts/amateurs-mind/center-and-space/</guid><description>Amateurs often have no clue of how to use center/space advantage, instead keen on forcing continuations, and unjustified attacks.
Rules of center Rule 1. Full pawn center gives control and space. A full pawn center gives its owner territory and control over key central squares.
Rule 2. Owning a center is responsibility. Owning a full pawn center is a responsibility. You must make it indestructible, and you will cramp your opponent.</description></item><item><title>Pawn Structure</title><link>http://yanghu.github.io/chess/posts/amateurs-mind/pawns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 23:04:49 -0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>http://yanghu.github.io/chess/posts/amateurs-mind/pawns/</guid><description>Knowning which pawn structure is &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; is not enough: one need to know how to attack them, or making use of the weaknesses.
In general, the formular to attack weak pawns(isolated, backward) is to control the square in front of the pawn so it can&amp;rsquo;t advance. (the squares are usually weak since no pawn can defend it). Then pile up on the weakness.
Every structure has its pros and cons.</description></item></channel></rss>
