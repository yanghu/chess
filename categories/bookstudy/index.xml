The initiative White has the move, which means initiative. He tries to first control the center, or obtain some positional advantage, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible for him to keep on harrassing the enemy.
He only relinquishes the initiative when he gets for some material advantage in return.
Diract attack en masse Attack en masse Attacks must be carried on with sufficient force to gurantee its success.</description></item><item><title>5.

The sudden attack from a different side Similar to general theory, the idea is to first attacking on one side, then, with greater mobility of the pieces, quickly transfer attack to the other side and break through, before the opponent can respond.
Rooks and pawns endings The rooks and pawns endings are difficult. Usually, the idea is to forcing opponent to defend a weak point, removing their mobility, and use our own greater mobility to switch side and attack.</description></item></channel></rss>
