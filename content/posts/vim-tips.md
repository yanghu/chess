## Buffers

* `{count}Ctrl-^`: Jump to buffer number `count`. Very useful with tabline
where buffer's numbers are shown on top.

## Files explorer

* `p`: preview the file. To close preview: `c-w z`.
* `P`: open the file in previous window. Usually more useful than `<cr>` which
opens the file in netrw window.
