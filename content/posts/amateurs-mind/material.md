One tip to avoid easily losing material: write down your move first, then ask: after the move: 
does my opponent have any checks/captures/threaten any of my pieces?

## Rules of material

### Rule 1. Material beats the initiative if you can neutralize the opponent's pluses and equalize the game.

It may take several moves to achieve that, so you have to ask if you have the time.

### Rule 2. Material gives you extra unit of force. If you make the extra unit active in the game, you can win.

### Rule 3. Material edges like the Exchange are only useful if you have open files for the Rook. Don't simply do point count: consider the particular position.

An advanced, centralized Knight can easily beat an inactive, useless Rook. The diagram below is an example.

### Rule 4. Your pieces could be off balance when you win material. Don't keep lashing out. Bring your pieces back together, make things tight and safe and prepare new plan. Don't rush to use material advantage. 

## Games

### Kramer-Thomas, 1949

Black has space advantage, while White has material (Rook for Bishop) and pawn majority on King side.

When you try to find a plan, you must base it on **the advantages (positive imbalance) in your position**.
 _White_ can use his material advantage by creating open files for his Rooks. _Black_ should try move his pawns to dark squares (b6, c5), then make his Bishop powerful(b5->d3), while keeping position closed.

 Also, you need to try to STOP your opponent's plan: for white, it's easy: prevent black's pawn advances.(by pushing his own pawn to b4)
