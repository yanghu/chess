Imbalances: the _static_ and _dynamic_ differences.

## List of imbalances

* **Minor pieces**: the interplay between Bishops and Knights
* **Pawn structure**: doubled/isolated/backward/passed pawns, islands.
* **Space**
* **Material**
* **Files and squares**: files, ranks and diagonals act as _pathway_, while squares act as _homes_. 
* **Development**: this is a temporary balance.
* **Initiative**: also temporary.

## Bishop vs Knights

It's the most important imbalance of the game.

### Basic rules of minor pieces

1. Both worth 3 points. It's up to you to manipulate the position to make your piece more valuable.
2. Bishops are best in open position, where pawns don't block their diagonals.
3. Bishops are strong in end games where both sides have _passed pawns_: the long range ability to control.
4. "Bad" bishop is the one having same color with your center pawn. However _bad_ Bishop can still be active.
5. Bishop's weakness is it can only control one color. A **pair** of bishops is very strong.
6. Knights love _closed positions_ and _locked pawns_. The ability to jump over other pieces make them valuable.
7. Knights are usually better in the center.
8. Knights needs secure, advanced homes to be effective. (6th rank is the best!)
9. Knights are superior in end game if pawns are on one side.
10. Best way to fight Knights is to remove their advanced support points.

### Example games

#### Silman-Gross: Quiet position

In this position, the imbalance is Bishop vs Knight. So, white's plans are:

1. Limiting black's Knight's advance points, by b-pawn pushes.
2. Moving his Bishop to a better diagonal(e3).

{{< lichess-embed src="https://lichess.org/study/hqu5fUxj/LR1YGLFi#38" >}}

The key here is to understand the position, stick to the plan(improving the pieces), and not get distracted.

{{< admonition type=note title="Tips on Bishop vs Knight" open=true >}}
1. If you have Bishop, try limit advanced support points of Knight. 
2. If you have Knight, try to create advanced homes for it.
3. Understand the imbalance, then make the position more valuable to your side.
4. Don't focus on individual moves before having a plan.

#### Fisher-Taimanov: Act quick

In this position, the imbalances are: 1. _Bishop vs Knight_ and 2._Pawn majority on Queen side_

Black is attacking h4. But if we focus on **imbalance**, we'll see
that, Black's Knight has a perfect home at c5, where:

1. It's a hole, and a light square, so White's _dark_ bishop has **no way** to kick it away.
2. It blocks white's pawns on Queen side(and attacks them), making his pawn majority useless.

With the vision of such **imbalance**, White's priority is to stop the Knight, use his queen side majority. 
White's idea is to create a passed pawn.(Majority, and Black's pawn is pinned)
Sacrificing h4 on _King's side_ is not big deal: white's _Queen's side_ can win him this game.

ALl the imbalances shows white should act on queen side, instead of defending h4:

* Knight vs Bishop: Stop Knight from getting to c5.
* Knight vs Bishop: White's Bishop is supporting Queen side's pawn push.
* Pawn majority: White has pawn majority on Queen side, and there's chance to attack.

{{< admonition type=note title="Identify your strength and act quick" open=true >}}
1. Find your strength by looking at the imbalance, and use it before it goes away. 
Sometimes, that means act immediately, even sacrificing on other parts.
2. Also, find your opponent's key plan by checking imbalances, and stop it.
3. Rooks belong behind passed pawns!

#### The game between C players

This game has lots of doubious moves, but is a good lesson on imbalance, and how not to play.

#### Choice: Close position or take away Knight's square

No rule is correct all the time. For example, in a BvN game, a move that takes away Knight's square may also
close the position. What do you do?

[Chess.com lesson](https://www.chess.com/fi/lessons/silmans-lessons-in-strategy-1/longren-silman-santa-barbara-1989)

Correct play is NOT to kick the Knight: it **closes the position** and dimnishes the Bishops. Black should
open us the position instead, by f7-f6 to support e6-e5.

* [The game with annotation](https://lichess.org/study/JNArtdz2/548VaegM#1): We can see that, once the 
position is open, White's Knight becomes a weak point, requiring defending, while Black's Bishops+Rooks are 
all activated.

[Same position, Silman v 1700, with incorrect play(kicking the Knight)](https://lichess.org/study/JNArtdz2/1muCqfxz#1): The 1700 student is too obsessed with checkmate threats, instead of trying to slowly improve the
position.

{{< admonition type=note title="Take away from 1700 game" open=true >}}
* Always assume your opponent will play the best response.
* If you have pair of bishops, opening up the position is more important than kicking the Knight.

#### Limiting the Knight when you have a Bishop pair

In the Hort's game, white has pair of bishop. Black's Knight has no chance on the Queenside, and white 
follows up with g5 and g4 to lock the King side.

#### Which piece to keep?

In this position, black has 3 choices:
* {{< mainline >}} 1... Rc5 {{< /mainline >}} for a R+N v R+B endgame
* {{< mainline >}} 1... Nxe4 {{< /mainline >}} for a pure Rook endgame
* {{< mainline >}} 1... Rd4 {{< /mainline >}} for a Knight vs Bishop endgame
