Amateurs often have no clue of how to use center/space advantage, instead keen on forcing continuations, and 
unjustified attacks.

## Rules of center

### Rule 1. Full pawn center gives control and space.

**A full pawn center gives its owner territory and control over key central squares.**

### Rule 2. Owning a center is responsibility.

**Owning a full pawn center is a responsibility. You must make it indestructible, and you will cramp your opponent.**

### Rule 3. Don't advance center too early.

**Don't advance the center too early! Every pawn move weakens some squares.**

In the following example, advancing e-pawn allows the Knight jump to d5 and f5.

### Rule 4. Attack your opponent's full pawn center.

One of the most common cases of allowing a "string" center in order to attack it is in the 
_Alekhine's Defense_.

### Rule 5. If center pawn get traded, the open file is good for Rooks to use.

In this example, the open e-file is nice for a Rook.

{{< mainline >}} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {{< /mainline >}}

{{< fen-diag fen="rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4" flip="" caption="Open center" >}}

### Rule 6. If the center gets locked, then the play switches to wings.

In this example, it's easy to see that the center is a dead zone, and play should switch the wings.

{{< mainline >}} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e5 4. Nc3 d6 5. e4 {{< /mainline >}}

{{< fen-diag fen="rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5" flip="" caption="Locked center" >}}

### Rule 7. With a locked center, play on the wing where your pawns point to.

**The pawns point to the area where you have more space, and that's where you want to control.**

In the diagram below, Black's pawn points to kingside. (c7-d6-e5). While whit's pawns points to both sides.

{{< admonition type=note title="In general, push the pawn that stands next to your most advanced pawn" open=true >}}{{< /admonition >}}

* For black, push ...f7-f5 next to the most advanced e5 pawn.(gaining space and opening a file for the Rook). 

* For white, he should push a pawn to side-byside with his d5 pawn. c4-c5 is good: gaining space on queenside, and prepare to rip open files. Pushing f2-f4 would be bad, after ...exf4, Black is very active, and e-pawn would be backward.

### Rule 8. An open center allows you attack with pieces. A closed center means you must attack with pawns.


## Rules of space

When you have more spcae, your pieces are easier to move/coordinate. However, as you advance pawns, some 
squares becomes weak. It's important to not over-extend too early.

### Rule 1. Avoid exchanges when you have more space.

In the example below, black's pieces are cramped and cannot even move. However, if we exchange and remove 
the pieces and only leave pawns, black would be perfectly fine.

{{< fen-diag fen="rnb2qr1/2p1nkb1/ppPp1p1p/3PpPp1/PP2P1PP/2NN2Q1/4BK1R/2B4R" flip="" caption="Cramped up with no where to go" >}}

### Rule 2. If you have less space, try to exchange to get room for your pieces.

### Rule 3. A spatial plus is permanent, long-term advantage. Don't rush to use it.
