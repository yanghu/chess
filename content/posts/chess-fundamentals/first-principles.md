### Single pawn

* The _King_ should be in front of his Pawn, with at least one intervening square.
* Advance the King as far as possible with the safety of the pawn, and never to advance the Pawn until it is essential to its own safety.

### Other Pawn Endings

{{< admonition type=note title="Don't push pawns prematurely" open=true >}}
don't push the pawn prematurely, which may send it to the opponent's King, and you can't protect it.
{{< /admonition >}}

In this position, if white pushes the f-pawn, the game draws because `... Kf7`. White is better to move his King and force the Black king to the corner, with help from `g6` push, controlling the f7 square .

#### Two pawns vs one

In this example, white cannot push the pawn, which results in exchange and draw. He need to first drive the Black king out of the way, before pushing his f pawn.

Another example of 2v1 in the above study.(see `2v1#2` in the same study) White should first move the King closer to the pawn, before pushing. Otherwise, Black can push and force pawn trades, then Black's King is in a good position to draw.


#### Three against two

{{< admonition type=tip title="Advance pawn with no opposition" open=true >}}
Whenever there's no reason against it, advance the pawn that has no Pawn opposition it in pawn end games.
{{< /admonition >}}

In this example, push any pawn wins, but push the f pawn follows the principle.

{{< admonition type=note title="Act immediately on the side where you have superior forces" open=false >}}
{{< /admonition >}}

Here, White's idea is to first act on the King side, pushing both pawns deep, locking Black's King to defend on King's side. Then, White's King is free to go to Queen side and win there.
