### The initiative

White has the move, which means initiative. He tries to first _control the center_, or obtain some _positional advantage_, so it's possible for him to keep on _harrassing the enemy_. 

He only relinquishes the initiative when he gets for some material advantage in return.

### Diract attack en masse

{{< admonition type=note title="Attack en masse" open=true >}}
Attacks must be carried on with sufficient force to gurantee its success.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Threatend attack

When there's no change to directly attack the king, we can demonstrate something on one side, drawing opponent force there, then use greater **mobility** of our force to switch to the other side and break through.  

See **Capablanca vs Blanco, 1913**

### Cutting pieces off the scene of action

Sometimes we can cut a piece (usually Bishop or Knight) from the scene of actual conflict. See **Winter vs Capablanca, 1919**.
