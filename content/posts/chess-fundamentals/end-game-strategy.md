### The sudden attack from a different side

Similar to general theory, the idea is to first attacking on one side, then, with greater 
**mobility** of the pieces, quickly transfer attack to the other side and break through, 
before the opponent can respond.


### Rooks and pawns endings

The rooks and pawns endings are difficult. Usually, the idea is to forcing opponent to 
defend a weak point, removing their mobility, and use our own greater mobility to switch 
side and attack.
